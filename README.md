# 📅 Dynamic Table : React Internship Assignment ⚛️

## --> [🔥Live Demo]()

## Task Breakdown

1. Create React App:

    - Use Vite to create the React app.

    - The app must use TypeScript, not JavaScript.

2. Add Prime React Table:

    - Use the PrimeReact DataTable component to display the table.

    - Initially fetch data for the first page and display it in the table.

3. Add Pagination:

    - Implement server-side pagination.

    - Ensure data is fetched from the server each time the user changes the page.

4. Add Row Selection with Checkboxes:

    - Allow users to select rows (either individually or select all).

    - Add a custom row selection panel (as explained in the video).

    - Row selections should persist when changing between pages (both selected and deselected rows).
